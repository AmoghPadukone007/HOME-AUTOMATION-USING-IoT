# HOME-AUTOMATION-USING-IoT

Home, it is the place where one fancies or desires to be after a long tiring day.
People come home exhausted after a long hard working day. Some are way too
tired that they find it hard to move once they land on their couch, sofa or bed.
So any small device/technology that would help them switch theirs lights on or
off, or play their favorite music etc. on a go with their voice with the aid of their
smart phones would make their home more comfortable. Moreover, it would be
better if everything such as warming bath water and adjusting the room
temperature were already done before they reach their home just by giving a
voice command. So, when people would arrive home, they would find the room
temperature, the bath water adjusted to their suitable preferences, and they could
relax right away and feel cozier and rather, feel more homely. Human assistants
like housekeepers were a way for millionaires to keep up their homes in the
past. Even now when technology is handy enough only the well to do people of
the society are blessed with these new smart home devices, as these devices
costs are a bit high. However, not everyone is wealthy enough to be able to
afford a human assistant, or some smart home kit. Hence, the need for finding
an inexpensive and smart assistant for normal families keeps growing. This
paper proposes such inexpensive system. It uses the [1] Google Assistant, the
[2] IFTTT application, [3] the Blynk application and [4] the NodeMCU
microcontroller as the major components along with a relay board comprising of
4/8 relays along with ULN 2803 IC. Natural language voice is used to give
commands to the Google Assistant . All of the components are connected over
the internet using WiFi which puts this system under [5] the IoT
